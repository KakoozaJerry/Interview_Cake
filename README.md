## Main Motive

As I journey through my interview cake account, am trying to brush off on my computer science basics.

I created this repository as a code Base for most of my work throughs and for future references.

The code base here mainly is commented out to guide you through and the function names used here are pretty straight forward to help one know what the code is actually doing.

While am also trying to improve my Javascrip skills, you will notice that all my files if not most have been written in Javascript. It is one of the top programming lannguages.
